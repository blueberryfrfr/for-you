          <span>My Love,</span>
          <br />
          Being with you makes even the simplest days feel special, and I always find myself looking forward to the next time we hang out. Whether weâ€™re laughing at something silly or just enjoying the quiet moments together, being with you makes everything better.
          I canâ€™t wait until weâ€™re together again in person â€“ just thinking about it brings a smile to my face. You make every moment brighter, and Iâ€™m grateful for every day that I get to call you mine.
          <br />
